a) How Does DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) Work?

The dollar cost averaging allows you to regularly purchase small quantities of the same asset; It removes the feeling of investing. That means you buy less when prices are high and more when prices are low. From a practical point of view, dollar cost averaging helps you get started with investing small amounts of money. For example, you may not have a large amount to deposit at the same time. Dollar cost averaging regularly releases smaller amounts of your money. That way, you don't have to wait until you've accumulated a larger amount to take advantage of the market growth. Regular investments of dollar cost averaging allow you to invest even when the market is down. For some people, maintaining investments during market downturns can be daunting. However, if you stop investing in falling markets or withdraw your current investments, you risk missing out on future growth.

How do custom signals work?
